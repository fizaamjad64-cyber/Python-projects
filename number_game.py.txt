# Simple Number Guessing Game
# Author: Your Name
# Description: A beginner-friendly Python game where the player guesses a number.

import random  # Import the random library to generate random numbers

# Generate a random number between 1 and 20
number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 20)

# Give the player 5 attempts
attempts = 5

print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
print("I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.")
print(f"You have {attempts} attempts to guess it.\n")

# Loop through the attempts
for attempt in range(1, attempts + 1):
    guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempt}: Enter your guess: "))

    if guess == number_to_guess:
        print(f"🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number {number_to_guess} correctly!")
        break
    elif guess < number_to_guess:
        print("Too low! Try a higher number.\n")
    else:
        print("Too high! Try a lower number.\n")

# If the player did not guess correctly
if guess != number_to_guess:
    print(f"😞 Sorry! The number I was thinking of was {number_to_guess}.")
