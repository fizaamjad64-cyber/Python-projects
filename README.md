# Python Projects

## Number Guessing Game 🎮
This is one of my first Python mini-projects and it helped me understand how programming actually works.  
The computer picks a random number, and the player keeps guessing until they get it right.

### Why I Made This
I wanted a simple project where I could immediately see the results of my code.  
This small game introduced me to:

- variables
- loops
- if/else conditions
- getting input from a user
- using the random module in Python

Seeing the program respond to my code gave me a real sense of achievement and made me even more interested in Computer Science.

### How to Run
1. Install Python  
2. Save the file as number_game.py  
3. Run it by typing: python number-game.py
